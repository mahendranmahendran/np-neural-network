This is an implementation of a neural network, with no hidden layers, just using [NumPy](https://numpy.org).
I made this project mainly to learn.

The NN is theoreticly capable of working with as many inputs as needed. The only thing that needs to be changed is the number of inputs (=number of weights).

### Used libraies

```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.pyplot import figure
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
import random
```
